[SD Maid SE](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se) (aka SD Maid 2) is a file management tool for Android that
specialises in maintenance. Its core purpose is freeing up space and removing unwanted data.

Features include:

* Removing data that belongs to apps that are no longer installed (CorpseFinder)
* Deleting expendable files, e.g. caches (AppCleaner)
* User configurable filters for random files (SystemCleaner)
* Scheduling actions (Scheduler)
* Controling/disabling apps (AppControl)
* Storage overview (StorageAnalyzer) (tbd)

[SD Maid SE](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se) is the successor
to [SD Maid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.thedarken.sdm). A complete rewrite, optimized for newer
Android versions, with a focus on [SD Maid's](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.thedarken.sdm) most
popular features. More details about SD Maid vs SD Maid SE can be found in
the [FAQ](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se/wiki/FAQ).
