SD Maid 2/SE is an app and file manager that specializes in knowing which apps have created specific files on your device. SD Maid 2/SE searches your device and compares files with installed apps to offer options for safely freeing up storage space.

✨ Clean up after uninstalling apps
If apps create files outside their designated folders then files can remain even after uninstalling the apps. The "CorpseFinder" tool finds app remnants, tells you to which app they belonged and helps you delete them.

🔍 Search your device the smart way
Filter for empty folders, temporary files, already installed apps and more. You can even create your own search criteria. The "SystemCleaner" tool allows you to automatically search your device and delete files based on various criteria.

🧹 Delete expendable files and hidden caches
Thumbnails, trash bins, offline caches and more: If apps don't clean up after themselves, then this app will. The "AppCleaner" tool finds apps with expendable files.

📦 Manage all of your apps
Get a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device. Enabled, disabled, user or system app: no app can hide from you. The "AppControl" tool is an app manager that allows you to search, sort and control your apps.

📊 What is using all your space
Storage management can be complex with apps, media, system, and other files across phone storage, SD cards, and USB devices. "StorageAnalyzer" is a file manager that displays how space is used on your device, simplifying your storage management.

📷 Find duplicate data
Duplicate downloads, photos sent through social media or just similar pictures of the same scene: Over time copies can accumulate. The "Deduplicator" tool finds files that are exactly the same or similar and helps you delete extra copies.
