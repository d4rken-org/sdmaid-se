Let‚Äôs not go on here‚Ä¶ Let SD Maid SE help you!

SD Maid SE is a file manager that specializes in knowing which apps have created specific files on your device. SD Maid SE searches your device and compares files and installed apps to offer options for safely freeing up storage space.

‚ú® Clean up after uninstalling apps
If applications create files outside of their standard directories then they are left behind after uninstalling them. The "CorpseFinder" tool finds app remains, tells you to which app they belonged and helps you delete them.

üîç Search your device the smart way
Filter for empty directories, temporary files, already installed app files or create your own search criteria. The "SystemCleaner" tool allows you to search your device and delete files based on various criteria.

üßπ Delete expendable files and hidden caches
Thumbnails, trash bins, offline caches and more: If apps don't clean up after themselves, then SD Maid SE will. The "AppCleaner" tool finds apps with expendable files.

üì¶ Find apps faster
A comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device. Enabled, disabled, user or system app: no app can hide from you. Use the "AppControl" tool to search, filter and sort through your apps.

üìä What is using all your space
Storage can be complicated: apps, media, system and other files. The "StorageAnalyzer'' shows used space per storage device (i.e. phone, sdcard and usb) and separates results into categories (i.e. app, user and system files).

üì∑ Find duplicate data
Duplicate downloads, photos sent through social media or just similar pictures of the same scene: Over time copies can accumulate. The "Deduplicator" tool finds files that are exactly the same or similar and helps you delete extra copies.
