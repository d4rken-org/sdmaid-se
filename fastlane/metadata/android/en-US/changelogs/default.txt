Hey ðŸ‘‹
SD Maid 2/SE is in active development.
It is still a very young app and not yet feature complete.
I'm working on new features every day.
If you have some good ideas, please let me know ðŸ˜Š!

Updates contain bugfixes, performance improvements and maybe new features.
A detailed changelog is always available on GitHub.

FYI: Itâ€™s just me here, sometimes replies might take a bit. Sorry for that!
